The LetsChat plugin store.

This is the plugin store for the LetsChat web framework, it currently only contains placeholders. I always make small frameworks and if I think they are useful in LetsChat I merge them into LetsChat once they are stable enough, but many of these frameworks are stable but might not be useful for every case in LetsChat but could be useful in certain cases. The LetsChat plugin store serves as a solution to this problem, where I will make plugins for LetsChat that I decided not to patch into LetsChat. I also plan to allow any third-party plugins in the future.
